## Development

It is written as a python module

## CI/CD

I use github actions for CI/CD.
As I am working alone on this project there is no strict development process.

### Tests

I test the code of the module with 100% line coverage,
or otherwise the pipeline will fail.

## Usage

```man
usage: aoc_2022 [-h] [-d {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}] [-p {1,2}] [-t] [-e] [-r REPEAT] [-q]
